## Project Description

This project is a calculator app that is able to execute multiple functions. The availible 
functions are add, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, log, exp, randomnumsrange, stringParse,
abs, factorial, mean, median, and mode. 

## Project Instructions 

### Pipenv Installation:
Ensure pipenv is installed:
if not:
'''
pip install pipenv
'''


### Integration of project into your existing code 

If you want to integrate our project code into your code, you can do so by...

#### Installation

You can install calculator project by using pip:

'''

'''
from calc import add, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, stringParse, log, exp, abs, factorial, mean, median, mode, randomnumsrange, cubesurfacearea
'''

Below is documentation for methods to be used in code


#### Documentation of out project's functions 

Our project has the following functions:
**add(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers, adds them together, then returns their sum. 
This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function. Example here:

**substract(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers, subtracts them from eachother, then returns their difference. This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function. Example here:

**multiply(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers, multiplies them together, then returns their product. 
This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function. Example here:

**divide(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers, divides them by eachother, then returns their quotient. 
This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function. Example here:

**mod(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers, calls the modulus operator, then returns the remainder. 
This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function. Example here:

**log(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers, adds them together, then returns the natural logarithm. 
This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function. Example here:

**exp(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers. x is multiplied by itself y times. The code then returns the product. This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function. Example here:

**randomnumsrange(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers. random numbers are generated in between 0 and x, y times. The code then returns the list of random number generated. This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function. Example here:

**stringParse(input)**: this function takes two numbers and any of the following functions previously
mentioned: add, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, log, exp, and randomnumsrange. The format for stringParse(input)
must be stringParse("number1 operation number2"). Examples here: 

**abs(x)**: this function takes a single number and converts it into its absolute value. Example here:

**factorial(x, val = {})**: this function takes in a number and returns its factorial value. Example here: 

**mean(list)**: this function takes in a list of numbers, sums them up, then divides them by the number
of numbers in the array, returning the average. Example here: 

**median(list)**: this function takes in a list of numbers, ordering the data points, and then finding the midddle number or taking the mean of the middle two numbers. Example here: 

**mode(numbers)**: this function takes in a list of numbers and returns the number that appears most 
often. Example here: 

**cubesurfacearea(x)**: this function takes in a number, calls our exp function with x, then multiplies the value 
returned by our exp function by 6 to get the surface area of a cube. 


#### Example Usage
