## Project Description

This project is a calculator app that is able to execute multiple functions. The availible 
functions are add, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, log, exp, randomnumsrange, stringParse, cubesurfacearea, abs, factorial, mean, median, and mode. 

## Project Instructions 

### Pipenv Installation:
Ensure pipenv is installed.
if not:
```
pip install pipenv
```


### Integration of project into your existing code 

If you want to integrate our project code into your code, you can do so by:

#### Installation

You can install calculator project by using pip:

```

```

Install Dependecies if needed:
```
pipenv install
```

#### Usage
To use it in your code, please import functions needed
```
from calc import add, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, stringParse, log, exp, abs, factorial, mean, median, mode, randomnumsrange, cubesurfacearea
```

Below is documentation for methods to be used in code


#### Documentation of out project's functions 

Our project has the following functions:

**add(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers, adds them together, then returns their sum. 
This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function.  

**substract(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers, subtracts them from eachother, then returns their difference. This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function.  

**multiply(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers, multiplies them together, then returns their product. 
This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function.  

**divide(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers, divides them by eachother, then returns their quotient. 
This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function.  

**mod(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers, calls the modulus operator, then returns the remainder. 
This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function.  

**log(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers, adds them together, then returns the natural logarithm. 
This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function.  

**exp(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers. x is multiplied by itself y times. The code then returns the product. This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function.  

**randomnumsrange(x,y)**: this functions takes two numbers. random numbers are generated in between 0 and x, y times. The code then returns the list of random number generated. This function is **only** to be used within the stringParse() function.  

**stringParse(input)**: this function takes two numbers and any of the following functions previously
mentioned: add, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, log, exp, and randomnumsrange. The format for stringParse(input)
must be stringParse("number1 operation number2").

**abs(x)**: this function takes a single number and converts it into its absolute value.  

**factorial(x, val = {})**: this function takes in a number and returns its factorial value.   

**mean(list)**: this function takes in a list of numbers, sums them up, then divides them by the number
of numbers in the array, returning the average.   

**median(list)**: this function takes in a list of numbers, ordering the data points, and then finding the midddle number or taking the mean of the middle two numbers.   

**mode(numbers)**: this function takes in a list of numbers and returns the number that appears most 
often.   

**cubesurfacearea(x)**: this function takes in a number, is multiplied by itself then multiplies that product by 6 to get the surface area of a cube.
